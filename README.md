# about
always a work in progress, my attempt at capturing my personal philosophy as it grows and changes over time with new experiences and information

# mission
### action-oriented mission statement (feature request)
My purpose in life is to share my knowledge effectively and empower others to do the same.

### definition of success (acceptance test)
First, some definition definitions:

1. my knowledge
  * anything that I have read/encountered/experienced/learned/discovered/thought that has passed through my life
2. share effectively
  * sharing to reach the largest possible intended audience and they understood the intended message
3. empower
  * to leave others with a sense of control, capability, and energy to act

My mission is broad and lifelong, and my successes are ideally medium-to-major-sized and frequent. I expect my net positive impact on the world to take place via a compounding interest model. Each small win increases my probabilty of inspiring other small changes in myself and others that over my life will add up to a big gain for myself and others.

### example successes
1. tiny
  * Sharing content by others that have already summarized things that I agree with
  * Telling someone about something I'm less sure of but that they can look up themselves and that I think may help them
  * Connecting people in my network when asked

2. medium
  * Showing someone how to use a new tool that will help them
  * Connecting people in my network unprompted, when I think they will both benefit
  * Sharing content by others along with my own thoughts summarized in brief
  * Indirect mentorship (larger groups, annonymously etc)

3. huge
  * Helping someone resolve a problem or frustration 
  * Writing out and sharing my own ideas in longer format than pure commentary
  * Helping to create new tools or materials that improve learning and/or knowledge sharing
  * Direct mentorship of others (in person, on-going, etc)

### targeted domains to impact
* Computer Science literacy and access
* Educational pedagogy
* Relationship building and maintanence
* Minimalism
* Self-defense skills from predatory advertising techniques

# general thoughts
### conclusions so far
* If the person I am communicating with does not understand me, it is my failure, not theirs
* All emotions are valid and useful, not all responses to emotions are valid and useful
* Use of physical force should be applied as minimally as possible
* Humans are animals, with animal instincts like any other
* Humans must strive to understand the impact of our evolutionary nature on our individual actions
* Tools are never evil, only their use
* Morals, as a human concept, are ultimately relative and socially negotiated
* Insticts, as a functional reality of nature, greatly influence morals in predictable ways across human societies
* Frustration is an indicator that your level of caring is higher than your level of control
* The free sharing of ideas is the most powerful act one can perform
* The power of the Internet is it's capacity for enabling human idea sharing
* In any information gathering context, an important question is always "Which voices are not yet being heard?"
* Silence is often interpretted as acceptance and support whether we intend it or not
* The ability to edit and curate incoming information is an increasingly important skill
* Less is more once basic needs are met
* Anthropegenic (human-escalated) climate change is real
* We need to create tools that put modern data into human-comprehensible formats
* We hurt future generations with our unchecked resource consumption
* Facing the data and the reality of others can be painful but is necessary for self-improvement
* Errors / bugs / failures are opportunities for learning
* Re-framing situations as good/bad is a tool that can be abused like any other
* We are always learning something, whether we realize it or not
* Clear, honest communication is the best policy
* Game theory indicates that deception, cheating, violence, etc will always be considered viable strategies in certain situations
* I will always have blind spots that I must rely on others to point out to me
* Those in a relationship are responsible for building and maintaining it to meet their shared needs
* It is very hard to be honest with oneself about true strengths and weaknesses
* Frequent exposure to different ideas is important to personal growth
* Current forms marketing are often predatory and take advantage of human cognitive biases rather than relying on sound and fair reasoning
* Keeping information to yourself for the purposes of increased personal gain at the expense of others is greedy
* Keeping information to yourself until you have time to act on it first is lazy
* Sharing information freely so that others can strengthen or improve the idea even more is better for everyone
* Human readability and understanding is the most important feature of code after functionality
* Poor commit messages are a missed opportunity for communicating more clearly
