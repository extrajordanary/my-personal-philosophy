# my-personal-philosophy
Always a WIP, to be updated as life happens.

# conclusions based on my life experiences so far
* If the person I am communicating with does not understand me, it is my failure, not theirs
* All emotions are valid and useful, not all responses to emotions are valid and useful
* Use of physical force should be applied as minimally as possible
* Humans are animals, with animal instincts like any other
* Humans must strive to understand the impact of our evolutionary nature
* Tools are never evil, only their use
* Morals, as a human concept, are ultimately relative and socially negotiated
* Insticts, as a functional reality of nature, greatly influence morals in predictable ways across human societies
* Frustration is an indicator that your level of caring is higher than your level of control

# code philosophy
* Human readability and understanding is the most important feature of code after functionality
* Commit messages are just as important as the code or they are a missed opportunity
